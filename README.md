### Project Background
- The conflict between Palestine and Israel has been going on for a long time and is very complicated. It involves politics, history, and humanitarian issues.
- Many people, both civilians and military personnel, on both sides have been hurt or killed during this conflict. 
- It's important to study and understand the patterns and trends in these casualties. This helps us see how the conflict affects people.

### Data Source

- I downloaded the data from the "btselem" website, and it serves as the primary source for my project.
- The "btselem" website provides valuable information related to the topic of interest.
- This data is essential for conducting a thorough analysis and creating meaningful visualizations in my PowerBI project.

### Steps Followed 

1. Loading Data into PowerBI:
- The first step involved importing the dataset obtained from the "bestelem" website into PowerBI.
- The dataset included information on casualties, various parameters such as age, citizenship, type of injury, year, ammunition used, and more.

2. Cleaning and Manipulating Data in Power Query:
- Power Query was employed to clean and preprocess the raw data for analysis.
- Data cleaning included handling missing values, handling duplicates and data accuracy.
- Transformations were applied to structure the data in a way conducive to meaningful visualizations.

3. Dashboard Visualizations:
- The cleaned data was then used to create a comprehensive dashboard with a variety of visuals.
###Key visualizations include:
- Fatalities by Age: A breakdown of casualties based on different age groups, providing insights into the age demographics most affected.
- Fatalities by Citizenship: An analysis of casualties based on the citizenship of individuals involved in the conflict.
- Type of Injury: Visualizing the distribution of casualties by the type of injuries sustained during the conflict.
- Yearly Trends: A timeline showcasing the patterns and trends in casualties over the years.
- Ammunition Analysis: Exploring the impact of different types of ammunition on casualties.

4. Interactivity and User-Friendly Design:
- The dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore and drill down into specific aspects of the data.
- Filters, slicers, and dynamic elements were incorporated to enhance user experience and enable a more in-depth analysis.

### Data Visualization (Dashboard)
- Data visualization for the data analysis was done in Microsoft Power BI Desktop:
- Shows visualizations from Israel Palestine Conflict:


### Insights

#### Total Fatalities:
The total number of fatalities in the Palestine-Israel conflict is 11,997, This stark figure underscores the profound human cost of the conflict over the years.

#### Fatalities by Type of Injury:
The highest number of fatalities is attributed to gunfire, accounting for 10,548 casualties.

#### Fatalities by Citizenship:
The majority of casualties are from Palestine, with 10,663 fatalities, This emphasizes the impact on the Palestinian population, reflecting the localized nature of the conflict.

#### Fatalities by Age Group:
Adults, encompassing a wide age range, experience the highest number of fatalities, totaling 9,239.
This suggests that individuals in the adult age group are particularly vulnerable, possibly due to their active involvement in the conflict or their exposure to dangerous situations.

#### Gun Violence:
Many casualties were caused by gunfire, showing that guns play a big role in the conflict. Finding ways to reduce gun violence could be important for improving the situation.

#### Disproportionate Impact on Palestine:
More casualties are from Palestine, indicating that people there are more affected. Understanding their specific challenges is crucial for helping them and working towards a solution.

#### Vulnerability of Adult Population:
Adults face the most casualties, suggesting they are particularly at risk. Protecting and supporting adults in conflict areas could be a key focus for assistance.

#### Focus on Conflict Resolution:
Knowing the patterns of casualties is important for finding a lasting solution to the conflict. Efforts to bring about peace should consider the types of injuries and which groups are most affected.
